# Database Normalization Documentation

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the database normalization process for the IoT Intrusion System Dashboard. The database has been designed following normalization principles to ensure data integrity, minimize redundancy, and optimize performance.

## Normalization Analysis

### Current Normalization Level: 3NF (Third Normal Form)

The database design satisfies all requirements for Third Normal Form (3NF) and incorporates elements of higher normal forms where appropriate.

## First Normal Form (1NF) Compliance

### Definition
A table is in 1NF if:
- All columns contain atomic (indivisible) values
- Each column contains values of a single type
- Each column has a unique name
- The order of rows and columns doesn't matter

### 1NF Analysis by Entity

#### ✅ USERS Table - 1NF Compliant
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,          -- Atomic integer
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,     -- Atomic string
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,      -- Atomic string
    password_hash VARCHAR(255),     -- Atomic string
    role VARCHAR(50),               -- Atomic string
    is_active BOOLEAN,              -- Atomic boolean
    created_at TIMESTAMP,           -- Atomic timestamp
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,           -- Atomic timestamp
    last_login TIMESTAMP            -- Atomic timestamp
);
```
**Compliance**: ✅ All attributes are atomic and single-valued.

#### ✅ DEVICES Table - 1NF Compliant
```sql
CREATE TABLE devices (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,          -- Atomic integer
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,     -- Atomic string
    device_type VARCHAR(100),       -- Atomic string
    mac_address VARCHAR(17),        -- Atomic string
    ip_address INET,                -- Atomic IP address
    status VARCHAR(50),             -- Atomic string
    location VARCHAR(255),          -- Atomic string
    firmware_version VARCHAR(50),   -- Atomic string
    last_seen TIMESTAMP,            -- Atomic timestamp
    created_at TIMESTAMP,           -- Atomic timestamp
    updated_at TIMESTAMP            -- Atomic timestamp
);
```
**Compliance**: ✅ All attributes are atomic and single-valued.

#### ⚠️ JSONB Fields Consideration
Tables with JSONB fields (`security_rules`, `security_alerts`, `blocked_attempts`, `device_logs`) technically violate strict 1NF due to complex data types. However, this is an acceptable trade-off for:
- Flexibility in storing variable metadata
- Performance benefits of PostgreSQL's JSONB implementation
- Simplified schema evolution

**Justification**: JSONB usage is strategically limited to optional metadata fields that don't affect core business logic.

## Second Normal Form (2NF) Compliance

### Definition
A table is in 2NF if:
- It's in 1NF
- All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key
- No partial dependencies exist

### 2NF Analysis by Entity

#### ✅ All Tables - 2NF Compliant

**Primary Keys Analysis**:
- All tables use single-column surrogate keys (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
- No composite primary keys exist in the current design
- Therefore, partial dependencies are impossible

**Functional Dependency Examples**:

**USERS Table**:
- `id → {name, email, password_hash, role, is_active, created_at, updated_at, last_login}`
- All non-key attributes depend entirely on the primary key

**DEVICES Table**:
- `id → {name, device_type, mac_address, ip_address, status, location, firmware_version, last_seen, created_at, updated_at}`
- All device attributes are fully dependent on device ID

**SECURITY_ALERTS Table**:
- `id → {device_id, alert_type, severity, description, source_ip, detected_at, resolved_at, status, resolved_by, metadata}`
- All alert attributes are fully dependent on alert ID

## Third Normal Form (3NF) Compliance

### Definition
A table is in 3NF if:
- It's in 2NF
- No transitive dependencies exist
- All non-key attributes depend directly on the primary key

### 3NF Analysis by Entity

#### ✅ USERS Table - 3NF Compliant
**No Transitive Dependencies**:
- `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`, `is_active` all depend directly on `id`
- No attribute depends on another non-key attribute

#### ✅ DEVICES Table - 3NF Compliant
**No Transitive Dependencies**:
- All device attributes (`name`, `device_type`, `mac_address`, etc.) depend directly on `id`
- No derived or calculated fields that depend on other non-key attributes

#### ✅ SECURITY_ALERTS Table - 3NF Compliant
**Foreign Key Relationships Properly Normalized**:
- `device_id` references `devices.id` (proper foreign key)
- `resolved_by` references `users.id` (proper foreign key)
- No transitive dependencies through foreign keys

#### ✅ All Other Tables - 3NF Compliant
**Proper Foreign Key Design**:
- Foreign keys reference primary keys directly
- No chains of dependencies through non-key attributes
- Lookup tables would be separate if needed (not currently required)

## Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) Compliance

### Definition
A table is in BCNF if:
- It's in 3NF
- Every determinant is a candidate key

### BCNF Analysis

#### ✅ Most Tables - BCNF Compliant
**Single Candidate Key Design**:
- Most tables have only one candidate key (the primary key)
- No multiple candidate keys create determinant conflicts

#### ⚠️ Potential BCNF Considerations

**USERS Table - Email as Candidate Key**:
```sql
-- Both id and email are candidate keys
id → {name, email, password_hash, role, is_active, ...}
email → {id, name, password_hash, role, is_active, ...}
```
**Analysis**: This is BCNF compliant because both `id` and `email` are candidate keys.

**DEVICES Table - MAC Address as Candidate Key**:
```sql
-- Both id and mac_address are candidate keys (when mac_address is not null)
id → {name, device_type, mac_address, ip_address, ...}
mac_address → {id, name, device_type, ip_address, ...}
```
**Analysis**: This is BCNF compliant because both keys are valid candidate keys.

## Fourth Normal Form (4NF) Analysis

### Definition
A table is in 4NF if:
- It's in BCNF
- No multi-valued dependencies exist

### 4NF Compliance

#### ✅ All Tables - 4NF Compliant
**No Multi-Valued Dependencies**:
- The current design avoids many-to-many relationships that would create multi-valued dependencies
- All relationships are properly decomposed into separate tables with foreign keys

**Example of Proper Decomposition**:
Instead of storing multiple device types per alert in a single table:
```sql
-- BAD: Multi-valued dependency
security_alerts (id, alert_type, device_types_affected)

-- GOOD: Proper normalization
security_alerts (id, alert_type, device_id)  -- References single device
devices (id, device_type)                    -- Device type stored separately
```

## Normalization Trade-offs and Decisions

### Strategic Denormalization Decisions

#### 1. JSONB Metadata Fields
**Decision**: Include JSONB fields for flexible metadata storage
**Justification**:
- Provides flexibility for evolving requirements
- Avoids complex EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) patterns
- PostgreSQL's JSONB offers good performance and indexing

#### 2. Timestamp Redundancy
**Decision**: Include both `created_at` and `updated_at` in most tables
**Justification**:
- Audit trail requirements
- Performance optimization for queries
- Common business requirement for tracking changes

#### 3. Status Field Denormalization
**Decision**: Store status directly in main tables rather than separate status tables
**Justification**:
- Limited status values with low change frequency
- Performance benefits for dashboard queries
- Simplified application logic

### Performance Optimization Considerations

#### Index Strategy Supporting Normalization
```sql
-- Indexes support normalized design while maintaining performance
CREATE INDEX idx_security_alerts_device_id ON security_alerts(device_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_security_alerts_resolved_by ON security_alerts(resolved_by);
CREATE INDEX idx_blocked_attempts_target_device_id ON blocked_attempts(target_device_id);
```

#### Foreign Key Relationship Optimization
```sql
-- Efficient joins supported by proper indexing
SELECT sa.*, d.name as device_name, u.name as resolved_by_name
FROM security_alerts sa
LEFT JOIN devices d ON sa.device_id = d.id
LEFT JOIN users u ON sa.resolved_by = u.id;
```

## Data Integrity Through Normalization

### Elimination of Anomalies

#### 1. Update Anomalies - Eliminated
**Problem Prevented**: No need to update the same information in multiple places
**Solution**: Each fact is stored in exactly one place

#### 2. Insert Anomalies - Eliminated  
**Problem Prevented**: Can't insert partial information
**Solution**: Proper foreign key relationships allow independent entity creation

#### 3. Delete Anomalies - Eliminated
**Problem Prevented**: Deleting a record doesn't lose other important information
**Solution**: Related data is preserved in separate, properly normalized tables

### Referential Integrity Enforcement
```sql
-- Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity
ALTER TABLE security_alerts 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_security_alerts_device 
FOREIGN KEY (device_id) REFERENCES devices(id);

ALTER TABLE security_alerts 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_security_alerts_user 
FOREIGN KEY (resolved_by) REFERENCES users(id);
```

## Normalization Benefits Achieved

### 1. Data Consistency
- Single source of truth for each piece of information
- Automatic consistency through foreign key constraints
- No duplicate data requiring synchronization

### 2. Storage Efficiency
- Minimal data redundancy
- Efficient use of storage space
- Reduced backup and restore times

### 3. Maintenance Simplicity
- Changes to entity properties require updates in only one place
- Clear data relationships simplify application logic
- Easier to understand and modify schema

### 4. Data Integrity
- Strong enforcement of business rules through constraints
- Referential integrity prevents orphaned records
- Type safety through proper column definitions
